/*
 * CHESS
 * This game is created to explore algorithms and C++ in general.
 * It is mainly a project to gain experience and understanding in these topics,
 * so it probably won't be the best chess program.
 *
 * main.cpp
 * Created by Lukas Bos on 30/11/2017.
 * Initialize a board and the players and handle the immediate user input
 * Initialize a proper interface for the player/viewer
